Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

The field of machine learning has three main categories:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, making predictions based on input-output pairs. Common applications include classification and regression tasks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data without predefined categories. This includes clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment.

Machine learning has revolutionized many industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. As data continues to grow exponentially, the importance of machine learning in extracting insights and making predictions becomes increasingly critical.
